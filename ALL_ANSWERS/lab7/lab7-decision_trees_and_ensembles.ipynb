    "## 1) Decision Trees\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision trees are a very simple machine learning technique that can be surprisingly powerful and offer a much more easily interpretable decision making process than many other methods. As the name suggests, decision trees are comprised of a set of nodes in a tree structure. All non-terminal nodes are called *decision nodes* which typically have two child nodes and contain a conditional expression involving a single feature of the input data. For a given input, starting at the root node, this condition is evaluated and this determines which of the two child nodes are selected for evaluation next. Once a *leaf node* is reached, the decision tree is able to produce an output class (classification) or a target value (regression). In this lab we will focus on the case of classification tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a given dataset of input-output pairs, there are a number of ways to construct a decision tree that can accurately classify the set of examples. We will be using the implementation of decision trees from the scikit-learn library which uses the CART (Classification And Regression Tree) algorithm with the Gini impurity criterion (see [this](https://victorzhou.com/blog/gini-impurity/) for simple explanation of Gini impurity). This algorithm can be summarised as follows:\n",
    "1. **Obtaining the root node**: Test the possible splits of the dataset using conditions involving each of the input features and measure the Gini impurity of each split. The root node is given by the split that minimises the weighted sum of the Gini impurities of the two branches. The weights are equal to the number of data points that satisfy the condition of the corresponding branch.\n",
    "2. **Creating the remaining decision nodes**: Iteratively follow the same process as step 1 using only the data points that match the conditions necessary to reach this point in the tree.\n",
    "3. **Creating the Leaf nodes**: These nodes are created when one of the stopping criteria is met. This set of criteria includes the case where all points of each class have been completely separated by a split (i.e. when the impurity is 0) or when some maximum depth has been reached."

    "We trained and visualised a decision tree classifier, which showed how decision trees can provide an interpretable model for classification. We then implemented bagging to improve performance, then extended it to the Random Forest and Boosting methods. This should give some idea of how these three key ensemble methods are related to one another. Random Forest adds random sampling over features, while boosting re-weights the dataset at each iteration to focus on misclassified data points.\n",
