    "### 3.2) Bayesian Linear Regression model in PyMC3\n",
    "\n",
    "Without knowledge of the true model parameters, the goal of Bayesian linear regression is to obtain a distribution (posterior) over the model parameters from the data, $P(w_0,w_1,\\sigma \\vert \\mathcal{D})$. First we need to define a prior over the three parameters:\n",
    "- $p(w_0) = \\mathcal{N}(0, 20)$\n",
    "- $p(w_1) = \\mathcal{N}(0, 20)$\n",
    "- $p(\\sigma) = U(0, 20)$\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is the code to define this model in `pymc3`. Note that this code performs MCMC using a No U-Turn Sampler (NUTS) which operates using the same principles as the Metropolis algorithm but is much more efficient."

    "1. Experiment with changing the prior distributions within the model: \n",
    "    - How does changing the prior distributions' mean or variance affect the posterior belief?\n",
    "    - What happens if the uniform distribution prior over $\\sigma$ is changed to exclude the true value? (e.g. $p(\\sigma) = U(5, 20)$)\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. Introduce a new parameter, $w_2$, to the data generation code such that\n",
    "    $$ y_i = w_0 + w_1x_i + w_2x_i^2+ \\epsilon$$\n",
    "   and adjust the model to perform inference for this parameter from the data.\n",

    "## Wrap up\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab covered a number of topics so let's recap:\n",
    "- First, we looked at a simple example of a graphical model and showed how to go about efficiently generating samples from a distribution that factorises over the graph using ancestral sampling.\n",
    "- We demonstrated the power of sampling by using samples to estimate quantities relating to the distribution.\n",
    "- We then looked at using the concepts of MCMC algorithms to generate samples from probability densities that are otherwise difficult to sample from and implemented the Metropolis algorithm.\n",
    "- Finally, we looked at the PyMC3 python library and how its efficient implementations of MCMC algorithms can be utilised within a Bayesian Linear Regression model.\n",
